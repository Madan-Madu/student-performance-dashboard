ðŸ“Š Student Performance Analysis â€“ Portuguese Dataset
ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project analyzes the Student Performance dataset (649 records) using Power BI to uncover key factors influencing student grades (G1, G2, G3). The dashboard provides insights into the impact of family support, absences, failures, and parental background on final outcomes.

ðŸ›  Tools & Skills Used

Power BI â€“ Data modeling, DAX measures, and dashboard design

Data Visualization â€“ Interactive charts (KPIs, scatter plots, pie charts, heatmaps)

Data Analysis â€“ Statistical insights and correlations

ðŸ“ˆ Key KPIs

Average of G1: 11.40 (Min = 0, Max = 19)

Average of G2: 11.57 (Min = 0, Max = 19)

Average of G3: 11.91 (Min = 0, Max = 19)

ðŸ”‘ Insights

Students with family support (famsup) scored higher (Avg G3 = 12.06) vs those without (11.67).

Students with â‰¥3 failures had lowest grades (Avg G3 = 8.07) compared to those with none (12.51).

Children of teachers scored the highest (Avg G3 = 13.14) compared to other parental jobs.

Higher alcohol consumption and more absences correlated with lower grades.
